Amongst the earliest app that I built in my journey to learn Flutter. It was fun learning to use new flutter packages like audioplayers to add sound features for the Xylaphone app.

Each container of those 7 colors is a button that when you tap it anyone of those colors will emit a musical note from the assets folder. Feel free to use and make your own changes to the app.
